The simplest way: Copy sync_to_febuilder_disassembler.py to the plugins folder in IDA directory.

The recommended way: https://github.com/tmr232/Sark

# Configuration

It will ask you some questions at the first time you open an IDA database. Then your answers will be recorded and it won't ask for the same database next time.

If you would like to clear the record and reconfigure the plugin, run sync_to_febuilder_disassembler_reset.py, save and reopen your IDA database.
